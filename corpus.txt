In their respective articles, "Gender and Race: (What) Are They? (What) Do We Want Them to Be?" and "Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color," Sally Haslanger and Kimberle Crenshaw offer complementary perspectives on the complex and intertwined nature of gender and race. They both overlap in their discussions of gender and race but Crenshaw delves more into the intersectionality of women and black people. Haslanger argues that gender and race are not natural categories but social constructs imposed on individuals. She is a social constructivist. Haslanger believes that these categories are harmful because they limit our possibilities and constrain our choices (Haslanger 43). Crenshaw, on the other hand, focuses on the ways in which gender and race intersect to create unique experiences of oppression for women of color. She argues that intersectionality is essential for understanding the complex and multifaceted nature of discrimination. One way in which Haslanger and Crenshaw's work can be read together is as a critique of the traditional view of gender and race as separate and distinct categories. Haslanger shows how gender and race are mutually constituted, and Crenshaw demonstrates how the experiences of women of color are shaped by both their gender and their race. Both texts are concerned with the ways in which gender and race are used to justify social inequality. Haslanger argues that gender and race are used to create and maintain power hierarchies. Crenshaw shows how these hierarchies are used to justify violence against women of color. Haslanger explains how these social hierarchies are associated with different levels of status and privilege. For example, she argues that the category of "woman" is typically associated with lower status and less privilege than the category of "man." This is because women are often stereotyped as being weak, emotional, and unintelligent. These stereotypes are then used to justify gender inequality in areas such as employment, education, and healthcare. Women of color are often seen as in a liminal between the categories of "woman" and "person of color." This means that they are often subjected to the negative stereotypes associated with both categories. For example, women of color may be stereotyped as being hypersexualized and aggressive, which can be used to justify sexual violence against them. The court system also treats a black woman either through a black man's lens or a white woman's lens. Haslanger lays the foundation of gender and race and Crenshaw emphasizes how they intersect and intertwine and a person’s experience includes the intersection of gender and race. This is commonly referred to as intersectionality. Crenshaw argues that intersectionality is not only a descriptive tool, but also a normative and political one, that challenges the dominant frameworks of feminism and antiracism that tend to marginalize or erase the experiences of women of color. She advocates for identity politics that recognizes the diversity and multiplicity of identities, as well as the interlocking systems of oppression that affect them. She suggests that we should adopt a structural account of intersectionality that exposes the ways in which power operates across different dimensions of social life. Haslanger and Crenshaw are both concerned with the social construction of gender and race. Haslanger provided alternative ways of understanding and analyzing gender and race rather than the typical biological nature. This helps resist and at the same time reveals the oppressive structures society has created under these categories. Another connection between Haslangers and Crenshaws works is that they both criticize the essentialist and reductionist views of gender and race that fail to account for the complexity and diversity of human society. Haslanger rejects the idea that gender and race are fixed or natural properties that determine one’s essence or identity. She argues that such views are based on false or misleading assumptions that obscure the social and historical factors that shape these categories. Crenshaw also rejects the idea that gender and race are mutually exclusive or independent categories that define one’s experience or interest. She argues that such views are based on narrow or partial perspectives that ignore the intersections and interactions between these categories. Both Haslanger and Crenshaw's work shows how gender and race are used to create and maintain hierarchies of power that justify social inequality. By understanding these mechanisms, we can begin to challenge them and work towards a more just and equitable society. They call for a transformation of gender and race relations. Haslanger envisions a world where gender and race are no longer used to oppress individuals. Haslanger talks about gender and race in general and Crenshaw emphasizes on the issues of black women. Crenshaw calls for a world where women of color are free from violence and discrimination. Together these papers are tied in tackling issues of gender and race not only in the legal system but in society in general. Haslanger and Crenshaw's works provide a valuable framework for understanding the complex and intertwined nature of gender and race. They are not purely distinct, but they have a complex relationship. By weaving their insights together, we can better understand how these categories are used to create and maintain social inequality. One new question that I have thought of from all our readings and especially these two is: How can we apply the insights of Haslanger and Crenshaw to the current social and political issues that affect women of color, such as immigration, healthcare, education, and violence? This question could be explored in a longer paper that examines the empirical and practical implications of their works, as well as the possible ways of advocating or implementing their ideas. Even in a paper, there will be no definitive solution. The question is multi-faceted and can only provide ideas and steps towards a more equitable society. Equality and justice must begin from education which is a major step towards our goal.
